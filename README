# Code Repository:Kayak (fos homolog) is required for adult eye formation and eye function in Drosophila

This repository contains all code and analysis scripts used in the manuscript "Kayak (fos homolog) is required for adult eye formation and eye function in Drosophila" by [Author List], published in [Journal Name, Year] (DOI: [Link to DOI]).

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

*   `data/`: Contains example data and descriptions.
*   `matlab/`: MATLAB code for "Radial distribution function (RDF)".
*   `r/`: R code for "statistical analysis and visualization of RDF"].
*   `fiji-macros/`: FIJI/ImageJ macros for "Corneal nipples segementation quantification" and "Photoreceptor segemetation".
*   `results/`: Outputs generated by the scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started / How to Reproduce

### Prerequisites
*   **MATLAB** (version R2021a or later) with the following toolbox installed:
  *   `Circular Statistics Toolbox (Directional Statistics)`
*   **R** (version 4.1.0 or later) with the following packages installed:
    *   `tidyverse`
    *   `ggpubr`
    *   `scales`
*   **FIJI/ImageJ** (version 1.53c or later)

### Execution Order
To fully reproduce the analysis, please run the scripts in the following order:
1.  **FIJI Macros:** Run the macros in `fiji-macros/` to process raw images and generate quantitative data.
2.  **MATLAB Preprocessing:** Run `matlab/preprocessing/process_raw_data.m` to format the data.
4.  **R Figures:** Run the scripts in `r/figures/` to generate all plots for the paper.
